The guides provided in this folder were provided by Realtek in the driver
distribution. Use CAUTION with these guides as many have not been updated
as changes have taken place in the Linux econsystem over the last few years.

DO NOT use these guides without confirming with recent information that the
information is correct. Linux changes and improves over time but old,
outdated information hangs around. My recommendation is that you set your
search engine to provide links that are one year old or less so as to
weed out old outdated information.

Regards,
